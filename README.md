## Simple dungeon crawler with pseudo 3D graphics

Run make.bat to generate project files
In order to load a map you need to paste its path as a command line argument:

```
Roguelike.exe res/maps/lvl1.txt
```

You can create your own maps inside a .txt file where `#` is a wall and `_` is air.  
### Controls
Use `WASD` keys to move and your mouse to look around
